## GitHub structure

- **.readme** - don't touch (used for additional files for README.md)
- **[projectfiles](./projectfiles/README.md)** - store planning/design/docs.
- **[website](./website/README.md)** - store website in here e.g. HTML, CSS, JS.
  - **index.html** - empty index.html for use as the website homepage.
- **.editorconfig** - used to set up VS Code.
- **.gitignore** - don't touch (used to stop certain files from being commited to GitHub)
- **.README.md** - this is what are reading now.

## Goal

Build a microsite for SpaceX or NASA. This should focus on space technology.
A microsite is a branded, self-contained site, usually on a its own domain, with a single purpose and a limited number of pages. The purpose can be promotional or editorial, and be may linked to a specific event or period of time. A microsite is usually built as an addition to an existing brand website.

## Brief

- Create a microsite for SpaceX/NASA to raise awareness about space program activity around the world. The site should appeal to a specific target audience and provide links to more information, live feeds of launches, and so forth.
- The site should include a minimum of (4) pages, be responsive, and function well on a variety of platforms.
- The site should employ Javascript/JSON API for dynamic data and construction and styling of HTML/CS. While a calendar is not mandatory, some kind of schedule or timeline information is recommended.
- An HTML5 contact form with Javascript validation is required.
- The site should be well-designed and easy to use, and conform to WCAG standards.
- A detailed functional specification should be submitted.
- A Git repository should be set up specifically for this project
- Do not use Bootstrap or similar frameworks. We want to see your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

## Deliverables/Milestones

- [Week 1: Functional spec, project planning document, Gantt chart](./.readme/week1.md).
- [Week 2: Target audience, personae/storyboards, wireframe/prototype](./.readme/week2.md).
- [Week 5: Report with link to microsite, all files compressed to ZIP](./.readme/week3-5.md).

## Report

A detailed, well-structured report, including references, should be delivered in PDF format. NB: other formats (Word, RTF, etc) will not be accepted. The file should be named using the standard date-assignment-name format. Failure to comply to both of these requirements will result in the assignment not being evaluated.

### To be discussed in the report

- Introduction/Interpretation of the assignment
- Planning, functional spec, Gantt chart
- Target audience/research
- Graphic design: design principles, typography, color
- HTML/CSS: Semantics, structure
- SEO/Content Stategy/WCAG
- Interface Design: Personae/Scenario, Affordances, Navigation, Persuasion, Wireframing, Prototyping
- Javascript
- Implementation/rollout
- Conclusion

Please use the report template provided.
