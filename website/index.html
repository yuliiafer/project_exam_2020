                All that has ever existed makes our universe.
                It is everything we have ever known. We as humans are part of this wonderful creation.
                We are living on a rocky planet that is very large to us, but is a tiny spec in the infinite universe, hidden away in a cluster of billions of stars that makes up our galaxy. Our very own galaxy has billions of stars and planets in it. There are also billions of galaxies in our universe. So, this makes for a very large place altogether! While all of these galaxies, stars and planets have existed for a very very long time, they have not always existed.
